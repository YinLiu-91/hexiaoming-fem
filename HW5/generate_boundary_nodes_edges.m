%Xiaoming He, 07/02/2009.
%Generate the information matrices for boundary nodes and boundary edges.
%This function needs to be modified for different boundary conditons.
%Here, this function is for pure Dirichlet boundary condition.
%This function needs to be modified if we change the index of nodes and elements in "generate_M_T_triangle.m".
%We will use "FE" to replace "finite element" in the comments.
%N1_basis,N2_basis:The N1 and N2 for the FE basis functions,not the partition.
%N1 is the number of the sub-intervals of the partition in x-direction.
%N2 is the number of the sub-intervals of the partition in y-direction.


%boundary_nodes(1,k): specifiy the type of the kth boundary node.
%boundary_nodes(1,k)=-1: Dirichlet boundary node;
%boundary_nodes(1,k)=-2: Neumann boundary node;
%boundary_nodes(1,k)=-3: Robin boundary node. 
%boundary_nodes(2,k): global index of the kth boundary node among all nodes of FE. 
%                     That is, the index of FE is used here.
%boundary_edges(1,k): specifiy the type of the kth boundary edge.
%boundary_edges(1,k)=-1: Dirichlet boundary edge;
%boundary_edges(1,k)=-2: Neumann boundary edge;
%boundary_edges(1,k)=-3: Robin boundary edge. 
%boundary_edges(2,k): index of the element which contains the kth boundary edge.
%boundary_edges(3:4,k): indices of the two end points of the kth boundary edge among all grid points, not the nodes of FE.
%                       That is, the index of partition is used here.
%More explanation is in my "Notes for tool box of standard triangular FE" section 1-6.
