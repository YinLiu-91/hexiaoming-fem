%Xiaoming He, 07/08/2009.
%Generate the information matrices for boundary nodes and boundary edges for Stokes equations.
%This function needs to be modified for different boundary conditons.
%Here, this function is for pure Dirichlet boundary condition.
%This function needs to be modified if we change the index of nodes and elements in "generate_M_T_triangle.m".
%We will use "FE" to replace "finite element" in the comments.
%N1_basis,N2_basis:The N1 and N2 for the FE basis functions,not the partition.
%N1_partition,N2_partition: The N1 and N2 for the partition, not the FE basis functions.
%N1 is the number of the sub-intervals of the partition in x-direction.
%N2 is the number of the sub-intervals of the partition in y-direction.

%boundary_nodes(3,k): global index of the kth boundary node among all nodes of FE. 
%                     That is, the index of FE is used here.

%boundary_edges(2,k)=-2: Stress boundary edge in tangential direction;
%boundary_edges(2,k)=-3: Robin boundary edge in tangential direction.
%boundary_edges(3,k): index of the element which contains the kth boundary edge.
%boundary_edges(4:5,k): indices of the two end points of the kth boundary edge among all grid points, not the nodes of FE.
%                       That is, the index of partition is used here.
%boundary_edges(6:7,k): the unit outer normal vector at the kth boundary edge.
